# Motion Sensitive Time Compression

Video processing tool for an experimental motion sensitive time compression effect.

This is really quick and gross code that you *will* need to read, understand, and edit if you want to reuse any of it.

Requires OpenCV 4 with CUDA support as well as CUDA video decoding support.
